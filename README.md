# Stock-Trend-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks

The main objective of this project is to predict stock market trends of US markets (NYSE, NASDAQ, S&P500) using different machine learning techniques. The prediction model uses inputs like Stock historical data, MA (moving averages), US fed rates, US gross domestic product (GDP) data, and oil rates. Some of the neural network architectures used are, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The research explores hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to optimize model performance. The research in addition with the traditional features, included non-traditional features like Fed rates, Oil rates, and other economic data. The developed predictive models are deployed on streamlit, enabling interactive engagement with forecasting tools. This deployment helps users to interact with and explore the prediction on stock market trends using various models.
